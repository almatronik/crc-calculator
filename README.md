# CRC Calculator

This is the assignment that I did as end of C course assignment. This was the 'VG' assignment for those who wanted a better grade.

Its function is to accept a message from the user (array of chars), convert it into binary and then calculate the crc and feed it back for validation while doing all the calculation steps visually on terminal.

While the CRC function works correctly I consider it a failure since it is not using bitwise operation but rather all the logic of the crc is done with arrays. Nevertheless I am happy of achieving since this was the first big project that I did in C and I learned a lot.

Nevertheless I will redo it properly once I have a bit more free time on my hands.
